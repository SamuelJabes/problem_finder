We had a team that could pre-assign you to a room; but there was too many factors. Was the room ready? Did the prior guest have a late check out? Has housekeeping cleaned that room yet? Did engineering come by and fix the tv issue? Was it placed on hold due to a plumbing issue? But more often than not, you’d be surprised at all of the changes due to guest preferences. Guests who wanted to upgrade to better views, rooms. People who were traveling with a group but wanted to be on the same floor, people not wanting certain floor/room numbers. Guests having multiple reservations one for their wife and the other for their mistress, you name it. Also being Forbes rated, we also had to make sure we offered x amount of recommendations in our dialogue to a guest, sending in a ticket to another system for your luggage.

My wife and I patiently waited while obviously jet lagged from crossing the Atlantic to Europe. We were nodding off after spending the day sightseeing, when the clerk told us a room was ready. I did book a room with a particular view, but I really don’t think I booked the level of room we received.

And it is fucking time consuming to enter 2 or 3 times.The key card machine can also take a moment and we have to be sure it coded the key correctly so that it works!\n"

The issue is that the pms can't catch up to it. I obviously don't know about other properties but the software that our property used has to go through a 3-5 second loading for every single click. Opening up the deposit screen. 5 seconds. clicking the deposit button to open up the transaction page. 5 seconds. running the card. 5 seconds. finalizing the transaction and closing the window. 5 seconds. Click the check in button. 5 seconds. Choose payment method and check you in. 5 seconds. Open up our folio options. 5 seconds. click folio be to create one for the incidentals. 5 seconds. go into the incidental folio. 5 seconds. Post an incidental charge in the folio and come back to the reservation page. 5 seconds. Open up the transaction window once again to authorize the incidentals. 5 seconds. Have you run the card for the incidentals. 5 seconds. close the transaction window. 5 seconds. So yeah. That's the primary reason. I know exactly what to do when a guest checks in and if the pms allowed me I would be able to do it within 25 seconds. Unfortunately the our pms has to sync with the server for EVERY SINGLE INTERACTION that I make with it.

This includes slavery-era south. To hear Americans talk about it, by and large, it was 400 years ago, not nearly as brutal as liberals would suggest, and only a small number of people actually owned slaves, so it really wasn’t as widespread as it’s made out to be.

Hopefully that goes better. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Goal is to just make enough money to open a coffee shop and wine and charcuterie place with my fiance/ soon to be wife. Idk how you guys do that for 20+ years. I feel especially bad for new graduates. PE taking over, expansion of foreign teams, having to redo their work on top of your own, 60-70 hour weeks during busy season and 40-50 during non busy season. Sure you can make 150 a year in 5-7 years, after giving up all of your free time for 4 months out of the year every year. But that doesn’t even buy you a house in a lot of metros anymore bigger than a 2 bed 1 bath. I’m sure accounting used to be a solid career, and still might be if you don’t want to have a life for a number of years. But I’m just not willing to give up that time to make someone else millions of dollars.\n",
