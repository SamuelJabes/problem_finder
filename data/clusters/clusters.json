        "How a $47,000 payroll mistake almost killed my agency",
        "Wow. This is horrible service on a very different level. Imagine their clients who are yet to wake up and realise this.",
        "Thera is the best payroll service. My team started growing globally and I got burned by Gusto, so it made sense to make the switch. Less expensive either",
        "That's brutal. Payroll is the ONE thing you pay these services to handle because screwing it up wrecks your business (and sanity). Insane how they didn't even have the decency to warn you when things broke. Good move cutting ties, after something like this I'd never trust another SaaS blindly again. ",
        "Talk to the IRS. They waived the penalty for the tax mistake my accountant (read: husband) made because it was our first incident and we resolved it.",
        "for what it's worth.  I agree with you.  Gusto is garbage.  They're one of the worst of 'promise the world' but never deliver.  Avoid 'em. Curious how thera goes for you",
        "Damn that’s messed up, we use Gusto with 2 companies and the 2nd one had issues getting the tax stuff setup right with the state. Please keep us posted",
        "Definitely sue them for breach of contract. You paid a fixed amount for their services, with a promise of specific and measurable tasks, and you have a quantifiable number for your real damages. This is the kind of thing you ",
        "Similar thing happened to me with Quickbooks Payroll.  Had to contact them multiple times to hear how they’ll resolve it asap and never figure out the problem.  When I got the IRS lien notice my language got stronger and they figured it out!  They claimed the IRS reassessed my payroll tax and didn’t tell anyone which I’m not sure I even believe.  They are covering my penalties as a credit since they did accept responsibility as the ones running my payroll. Still sucks to have a surprise $5k payment when you think you’re doing everything above board by hiring a professional payroll service",
        "I’m going to commit unspeakable acts if I have to see that stupid Gusto loading “friendly pig” one more time.",
        "Having been with ADP before Gusto and having used Gusto for years across 3 businesses , I can tell you that ADP is far worse and makes far more errors. That said, Gusto isn’t perfect by any means and getting an answer from them takes far longer than it should",
        "Just want to share that rippling and other payroll software showed similar issues and a very poor attitude to fix.",
        "this is stuff within spectrum of running a small business. Just sue them, and make them pay your legal bills, lost business income, personal time wasted, and government fees. Let the lawyer handle it.",
        "I would get a payroll service that guarantees their service. Quickbooks full service guarantees their work. So when they do mess up on late payments or a return they pay the penalties and interest.",
        "You have immediate grounds for legal issue. Run do not walk to your nearest attorney.",
        "Ask me about my bench.co and TaxRise nightmare.",
        "This is why it pays just to suck it up and have a payroll position where that person is your salaried employee. It will cost you more but well worth it.",
        "Was this for Q1 of this year? My company uses Gusto and I just got three late filling penalty letters from three different states. After looking into it, Gusto filed them all two weeks late even though they had the info and had been filing every cycle without an issue for the last two years.",
        "They always fuck up proper taxes.  But then never handle it, fix it, and business is stuck with penalty.",
        "I’m lawyering up all day on this one!",
        "You are paying $600 per employee per month for payroll automation? 600x23 = $13,800 per month?... and there is no guarantee of accuracy or service-level agreements?",

        "Thank you so much for saying this. Try to purchase solar, gutters, basically any mildly complicated service or product and the consumer is chasing the company for months!",

        "Feeling frustrated because parents want me to put their new car under my name and co-sign the loan",
        "What can I use my FSA for?",
        "What state are you in? This sounds like a bait and switch scam. If the office that sent the “free screening” offer can’t demonstrate they really were doing free screenings, they might be violating rules in your state. ",
        "Tell them \"I came in for the free screening, that is what was on my confirmation email. Here is said email. If you performed something that ",
        "Common bait and switch they do. I don’t have any advice but I’ve heard of this happening before. It’s free up until you trail off and change the conversation topic with the doctor, you start talking about other things and all of a sudden it isn’t free. It’s a trap",
        "OP even if the screening morphed into a regular visit 1300 dollars seems extremely high and something your insurance should’ve written down (deductible or not). You may end owing something but that seems extremely excessive.",
        "This is something that all doctors are doing now.  I went in for my yearly checkup and we discussed issues as I'm aging.  Bam, I got charged for a visit due to getting a new treatment recommended.  What's the point of the yearly exam if talking to your doctor about anything going on will charge you anyway as a different type of visit?",
        "one star reviews on all review platforms and name the doctor.",
        "This happens all the time with us, we go for our free annual checkup and find a bill for $400-500 each after a week. my wife then has to call the doctor's office and argue with them until they recode everything so that it counts as an annual free checkup.",
        "You may be able to get the price reduced by getting a retroactive referral from your primary care provider",
        "Complaints to the state ag office, medical ethics board, and your insurance company. At best this was \"bait and switch\" at worst outright fraud.",
        "File a chargeback for the $140 you paid too.",
        "I would start by reaching out to your PCP to see if they will put in a referral for urology retroactively. I believe a referral can be placed retroactively up to 30 days(?) after the specialist visit, at least in my state.",
        "Do you have ACA insurance? In my experience, doctors will almost always try to convert those \"free screening\" visits into an office call by getting you to talk about things that fall outside the umbrella of a \"free screening.\"",
        "Reach out to the patient advocate for the hospital/clinic system, explain the situation. They often escalate it to managers. Unless it’s private practice the doctor does not have much control here. They will light a fire under the clinic until your problem has a definitive answer. If you booked under free screening and that was what you were under the impression was happening, they should not be charging you for the visit.",
        "That’s beyond frustrating, and honestly it sounds like a bait-and-switch. First step is to dig up that original email confirmation with the words “FREE SCREENING” and save it like gold. That’s your proof. Then file a formal dispute with the clinic’s billing department in writing, referencing that email and every detail of the scheduling switch. If they won’t budge, escalate it to your state’s medical board and insurance regulator.",
        "Part of this definitely sounds like shady business practice.  Part can be chalked up to \"things people might not understand about insurance\" until they are looking into it.  A few things that caught my attention:",
        "Same exact thing happened to me with a colonoscopy. Since I have a very strong family history of colon cancer, when I turned 19 I was supposed to start getting a colonoscopy yearly, (because my dad died of colon cancer at 29yo) but just got my first one in 2023 when I was 23. Every appointment was “this will be a screening based on family history”, yet when the colonoscopy was scheduled and I’m all checked in, they go “and that will cost 1150 how will you be paying today?” LIKE HELLO??? They said because I mentioned anal bleeding ONCE due to an internal HEMORRHOID that my colonoscopy was now not a screening, and insurance wouldn’t cover it. LIKE WTF?? HOW IS THIS LEGAL??",
        "Tell them to kick rocks and that if they continue to harass you you'll be contacting a lawyer for false advertising and predatory practices. ",
        "I’m wondering since you have a family history they coded it as a diagnostic test instead of just a general screening. Were you having any symptoms?  That can cause a coding change as well. Definitely call your insurance",
        "Replying specifically to your edit, OP.  Honestly, this shouldn't rely on how they coded it.  Or rather, you shouldn't be on the hook automatically because they coded it wrong.",
        "If you’ve tried to work it out with them and they refused, report credit card fraud and complain to your state’s attorney general. Make those greedy scumbags sweat.",
        "I would still make it a policy NOT to hand over payment until i have all the required information to make sure amounts are correct.  Sending me a bill when my insurance covers services seems unreasonable.  If they can’t provide reasonable information, like the charges was this for this item, and insurance covered this amount, then they are sending an incomplete bill.  And I would need that information to verify with insurance payments.  If they don’t match, they have incompetent staff or they are a shady practice.  ",
        "Yup! My primary doctor did the same thing to my regular annual visit. I’m in the process of finding a new doctor.",
        "I've seen this with vaccines, too. They advertise it as free, but require insurance when you get there. Really stretching the definition of free to mean \"Free to ",
        "Something like this happened to me and I called the hospital. I was adamant that three different people had told me it would be free and that I would NOT HAVE DONE IT if it hadn’t been. They removed the charge. You might be able to get out of it by complaining.",

        "I won’t be tipping anymore.",
        "It's only $25,000 in cash tips that are exempt from federal taxes. Employees must claim the tips so the employer can withhold payroll taxes. Almost no one claims the small amount of cash tips they currently get. This is literally just a way to get them to claim those cash tips and still get SOME tax from it, just not as much as it normally would be with federal taxes.",

I'm an HR consultant and people don't know that their actual culture, not their intended or marketed culture, is in the data.  So are ways to change it.  They don't know that you can measure unhappiness or toxic pockets by looking at data on theft, padded expense reports, time card fraud, ER issues that are more about personality than something that's an actual code of conduct violation.  And NO ONE uses recruiting data properly.  If I were to do a three year look back at hires, I would want to see who the recruiters and hiring managers were, what the interview process was, where they were sourced, what companies they came from, and any other commonalities of current employees.

She was the best.\nI check out her linkd in profile every now and then to make sure she's still practicing.

It’s possible it may be challenging to find someone using insurance, though, since sometimes insurance pressures are for fewer sessions that address current functioning and symptoms, rather than doing some of the deeper explorations you are looking for. You may want to consider whether it’s possible/accessible for you to pay out of pocket, which could expand the pool of possible therapists.",
        "Using insurance might make this more difficult as insurance companies are the ones who want that quick, solution-focused approach. You might be better able to receive this kind of therapy as a self-pay client. However, there are therapists who are seasoned in justifying medical necessity for the type of therapy you are seeking. If I were in your shoes, I'd probably look for therapists who pull from psychodynamic, EMDR, and attachment-focused approaches.",

I make a bee high quality travel content that I work really hard on. I was getting to the point where it was affecting my mental. So I decided to completely give up on it couple of months ago and try to grow in Tik Tok instead.\nBest decision ever in my life. Two months later in tik tok . I am pulling in almost million views per week. Got to rewards program and was even able to land few good collabs. I have about close to 30 legit collab  requests in just past 2 months. I just regret I wasted so much time in shitty Insta app. 2 years .. if I had given that time to Tiktok I would be probably at 100k followers in Tiktok.",
        "Big followers with very small likes has typically meant the followers were bought",
        "It's sort of hard to say. My Instagram account has 72,000 followers. Nearly every day I have a post get 1000+ likes. But other posts only get 200-300. It feels like I'm getting about half the engagement that I did a couple of years ago, when I'd regularly post content that gets 2000+ likes.",
        "People hate being advertised to- what a concept.",
        "It’s not dying just a Business as you follow don’t get any shares because they don’t add enough value to their audiences.",
        "Instagram is slowly but surely dying and this is a fact. I switched my brand from Instagram to Tapkeen and I am more than satisfied with the decision",
        "anything facebook is toxic, look east my friend",
        "Because IG is awful. You get caught in some BS, AI wheel that restricts you for nothing. Once you're caught in that wheel, you're basically fked. I got restricted for 10days for asking when a band was going to tour.  There is no recourse unless you've got 10000s of followers. \nShadow banning is bollocks.  You can not have any decent dialogue anymore. ",
        "Definitely not dying. It's just fundamentally changed as a platform over the lastr five years and most accounts struggle to understand 'new instagram' and I am guess the contant of those accounts is simply not engaging! I have two businesses and have grownt them faster than ever on Instagram in the last yearl You just need to know how to work with the platform now. I passionately believe it's the best platform for businesses in 2025 and I'm not just saying that. Most people just don't know how to use it.",
        "Instagram is dead. Zuck doesn’t get enough hate for what he did to FB and Insta. The platform is just teens making fake content - affiliate marketing scams and dropshipping scams and fake money posting, course sellers and grifters and annoying red pill content and anti trans shit and Russian propaganda. There’s no regulation so it’s all fake.",
        "Fake followers. I have 4.1K followers and get 500+ likes and 60+ (I respond to everything so technically 120) even had one with 200 comments and 1.2k likes. Stories are something else though. I sometimes get 1400 views, sometimes only about 300 for some reason.",
        "Since all of the Social Media platform interactions are infested with \"AutoBot Influencers\"... Ladies and Gentlemen, Humanity has left the building! I remember, back in the day, when Social Media was a platform for actual human beings to share ideas, activities and current events for HUMAN consumption and discussion. Yep... Those were the days!",
        "You can't rely on one source of exposure online. You need to build your brand across multiple platforms and use SEO, AdWords, Social. You need people to see your brand pop up in different spaces with different approaches depending on the audience. Social is very pay to play these days as well. Organic reach is mostly dead.",
        "They do whatever they want. They limit visibility, they push propaganda with their algorithms. There is noone controlling them. To this day I do not understand why EU has not banned all meta platforms exactly because of this. They are used to undermine EU from inside and push narratives that they want. Stupid EU sitting doing nothing, judt watching.",
        "Maybe those are paid followers = High follow count, no interaction.",
        "Short attention spans now. People have no time to comment anymore. Really sad to see how things are going with social media.",
        "There are tons of successful businesses on Instagram but if you aren’t adapting to be reels-first in 2025 you are going to fail, I see businesses on my feed all day on Instagram who have crazy high likes and views in comparison to their following. I also work with many brands making thousands to millions from Instagram posts and ads.",
        "They simply don’t actually have that many followers, lots of businesses buy followers to make it seem like they are popular when in reality they aren’t. Instagram is well and alive",
        "Yup. And it's frustrating because now that I want to be serious about IG for marketing my business, I'm expected to pay for visibility. 🙄 But back then when I wasn't trying, I got so much engagement on my posts for free. I was getting well over 30 likes, and I was getting frequent comments and shares! But yeah, now IG is a dying platform that only prioritizes influencers with millions of followers. This heavily hurts small businesses and artists that don't have the money to pay for ads daily.",
        "Most accounts on Instagram are filled with fake followers anyway.",
        "Instagram's organic reach has dropped a lot, especially for business accounts. A lot of those follower counts are inflated from years of giveaways, bots, or inactive users, which explains the low engagement.",
        "I was using an app to get followers but instagram discovered it, so my account got shadowbanned. Maybe that's happened to the accounts that you follow",
        "It's always been... unless you're a nation wide brand, marketing on social media is virtually pointless. A good website, with good SEO, and paid outreach is much more valuable",
        "I will say I’m more careful about what I hit like on because it’ll be shown to my followers. Get rid of that and the likes will come back",
        "I agree re Insta. I spent a lot of time building up 10k followers for our book business on there. Back in 2019/20 I’d get 500-1000 likes for posts. That started to die off slowly to double figures and now I’m lucky if I get 10 likes. Which is why I no longer bother and have built up an engaged following on TikTok and X instead which brings plenty of business.",
        "well who is your market audience? you have to treat these platforms as different personalities; viral posts on instagram could do absolute crickets on another app like tiktok.",
        "This is so true! Sometimes, the best way to keep up is to step back. I've found that giving myself dedicated 'no social media update' time, or even a full day off from tracking trends, helps prevent burnout."

Focus on living within your means (make a budget) and work to re-establish your e-fund moving forward. In the event of a true emergency while you have nothing in savings, you can use your cc and be no worse off than you are now.",

        "That does not apply when you are paying 28% interest!",
        "Yes, add up what you're paying in interest. Pay at least the 28% off. And then hope for a balance transfer promo and if there's enough credit,  transfer it and work hard to pay it off.",
        "If you keep at the rate you're going soon you're gonna have more debt than savings, sooner rather than later would be the right time to pay it off.",

When she realised I also had almost the exact same amount in a car loan debt, she gave me a very stern lecture on how idiotic it was to be earning 5% interest on 12k while paying 9% on the same amount at the same time.\nI didn't have the heart to tell her when I found out I was actually earning 0.01% interest because there was a bunch of different criteria required to get their actual advertised rate.",

        "I agree with the others. Be strategic, don’t deplete your savings but try to make debts on that cc pmt",
        "yes interest is way high. pay off today",

PAY THE WHOLE THING OFF. Do not build credit card debt. If this happens again consider getting rid of your credit cards.",
        "Yes, but then your lack of emergency fund is itself an emergency and you must treat it as such.",
        "Yes, absolutely. You're throwing money away. You should have been spending your emergency fund rather than credit cards. What do you think it's for?",
        "You need to pay it off. You will never get the total down with just paying the minimum. If you want to keep some savings, then keep 2K in savings, and use the rest to pay down your debt, which should leave you with 1.4K debt. Then be aggressive with paying that down as well.",
        "I’ve been around the block a few years more than you (okay a lot more) and would suggest a combined approach that others here have mentioned. It’s possible you could have an emergency of some sort where you can’t use a credit card. Also, card companies can cut you off at any time or reduce your credit limit with very little notice and you have to keep paying even though you can’t use the card anymore. This happened to a lot of people in 2008 and right now the economy is uncertain. And if you’ve depleted your cash, you could end up in a worse situation. So I would keep some in cash if it were me. ",

        "What in the hell are you doing, running an 8K balance on your credit cards at 18?",
        "8.4k is pretty wild at 18 but you could just kill it. I know it’s scary but I did something similar not too long ago, it sucked putting such a big dent in my savings but the projected time to pay off my credit card was a lot. ",
        "Yes. You're paying way more interest on that debt than you're earning on that savings account.",
        "Absolutely do not wipe your savings to pay these off. You should always have a couple grand available if you need it.  You can use some of the savings to make a decent chunk, maybe use 4K or something. Try to budget so you have extra cash to throw at it, start with the higher interest rate first. Then after that one is paid off focus on the other card. ",
        "Yes, but you need to stop using credit as much while rebuilding that savings.",
        "unless the interest on whatever savings account you have is 29% it makes the most mathematical sense to pay off the credit card debt instead of holding onto money you don’t really have. like other comments said- your credit cards can act as your emergency fund until youve built that back up"
