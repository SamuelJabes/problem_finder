But, the work is hard - the machines don't have manuals and no YouTube videos to look up. Younger people have come and gone. They don't like getting covered in dust, sweat, and grease for 12 hrs. Or, they don't have the \"mechanical mind\" to figure out the machinery when it breaks down.

The response time to each client can end up being too long for the client and so they go elsewhere, like to an inferior BetterHelp-type company.

  "I think, standing back, what I see is that companies have a bunch of data and don't know how to use it to evaluate systems and processes.  I'm an HR consultant and people don't know that their actual culture, not their intended or marketed culture, is in the data.  So are ways to change it.  They don't know that you can measure unhappiness or toxic pockets by looking at data on theft, padded expense reports, time card fraud, ER issues that are more about personality than something that's an actual code of conduct violation.  And NO ONE uses recruiting data properly.  If I were to do a three year look back at hires, I would want to see who the recruiters and hiring managers were, what the interview process was, where they were sourced, what companies they came from, and any other commonalities of current employees.  I'd look at the same info for people who had since left the company, vol or invol.  I heart data so hard.",

  "Yes, this is me.  I'm mostly a single man shop with a few helpers I'm trying to train up.  top of my pipe is full, overflowing.  I don't get back to every lead, once i send a quote or first contact, if they don't get back to me, I'm too busy with the new leads , work at hand or old leads chasing me to chase the old.    I don't like it, but it is what it is.",

  "And in the long term, if a tradesman is honest and not trying to just take advantage, I will continue to use that tradesman for life if possible. If someone is dishonest once, I will never hire his services again. If a honest tradesman does a good job, I will recommend him to everyone. Goes for tradeswomen too. But so many make up fictitious problems that don't exist. I once had surgery, and having replaced my tap before, I knew how to do it, but didn't have the strength. One plumber made a story about having to repipe everything under my sink without even seeing the problem in person. I blocked his number.",
  "I took over Sales Management at a CRO in the San Jose area and can echo your comments.  This company had all their info requests funneled to their “star” salesman, who was literally triaging the leads, cherry picking, and letting others lie.  The company had no clue what he was doing, and to top it off, he took the entire customer database with him.  They thought that was ok, too.",
  "Our company has a similar problem, all the sales people are overwhelmed and the design team is 3 weeks out on work, but we’re told to keep filling the funnel. Like at some point, people won’t give us another look if we keep taking this long.",

  "As a B2B buyer I’d agree. Anytime I see “ai powered” my bs meter goes off. I think it’s because when ai was first taking off 3 years ago every marketer was in a rush to sell their software using the lingo, thus diminishing its value. Especially since AI wasn’t even ready at the time. Things are different now though, but the stigma is still there. Forcing me to only trust few AI companies that I know will deliver like OpenAI, Google, PlayHT etc. PlayHT was actually ahead of the curve.",
  "As much as \"AI powered\" is a good example here (and I too hate anything that says AI powered), I'd argue it's not the difference between using AI or not using AI in landing page copy - what you did is switch from internally focused copy, to copy that focuses on the benefits to the customer - you wrote what the app delivers to the customer, not a vague description of how it works (which no buyer cares about).",

  "I have some “ai-powered” features, but I use the ✨emoji to hint that",
  "It's important to treat AI as an actual feature and not as a buzzword. Most SaaS buyers are smart enough to distinguish where AI is actually needed and adding value and where it is simply a catchphrase used for marketing.",

  "Couldn’t agree more. \nAI in your messaging implies there’s a machine doing stuff your company hasn’t really thought through by itself. That sounds risky. \nBuild for the pain you have identified and are solving. Use outcome based messaging that provides a better world. Let AI enhance your operating rhythm and effort. And mostly let it free up your most valuable resource - human time.",

  "Glad someone said it. A lot of existing startups also intentionally do it just to raise next round of funding as they follow the trend.",
  "When I see \"AI\" in any software or business tools, I'll skip it and continue to find what I need. \nIt provides little value unless the tool is specific for ai use. \nIf it uses AI in the background, sure, as long as it solves the initial problem.",
  "Interesting. I have taken to not talking about underlying technologies as much. I focus on the outcome or purpose of product and how it solves specific problems with real-world examples. \nWhen the prospect asks how I can guarantee the data is tamper-proof, I explain that I use an immutable transaction ledger that only allows read and write operations; no deletes or edits. If data needs to be changed a new transaction is added which supersedes the previous transaction but doesn’t delete it (it’s blockchain). When they ask how I transcribe all of the transaction metadata from uploaded documents into an immutable database and attach that data to the transaction and the actual stored files, I explain that I use a sophisticated OCR and vector database with dynamic events and webhooks (it’s Azure Computer Vision and Azure Form Recognizer AI).",

It feels like a handful of AI companies were able to capitalize on the trend but it started backfiring really fast. It’s good though because AI should never be the selling point. It’s sorta like cars, very few people walk around saying it’s a V8 twin turbo maximum output 4X4, they simply it’s a sports car then use it for what it can do. I think in some cases it can be a bragging point for founders but customers really don’t care, just solve my problem or else I move on.

  "Because we let the South off the hook and the slaveholders kept their land. Mostly.",

  "Okay after reading a ton of comments here I dont think like 80% of the people on Reddit understand how bad the transatlantic slave trade really was. Like you guys are scaring me a bit with how passive you’re all being about it. I promise you, it is so much more cruel, sadistic, widespread and horrific than you’re imagining.",
  "Think that can explain very well how America looks at/has dealt with racism vs how Germany has dealt with Nazi's.",
  "Because a lot of Americans don't believe that slavery was wrong.",
  "I agree, OP. I visited one and stood in horror as tourists and plantation staff discussed their confederate relatives and \"states rights\". I had just driven down through Mississippi, where the legacy of slavery is everywhere. But they somehow don't see it.",
  "Because the south was never punished for the civil war",
  "I think a lot of it has to do with how the north and south “moved on” after the war.  the south was left not well reconstructed and more or less neglected to nurse their grievances and create their own myths about what happened and how it played out.  Germany on the other hand was comprehensively destroyed, then occupied by the allies.  their leaders were called to account and tried at Nuremberg.  many of them were executed.  and as part of the post-war reconstruction and rehabilitation the Germans were forced to come to terms with what they have done.  America has never had a reckoning over slavery or the displacement of natives from their lands, but Germany has had their own reckoning.  that is my thesis about why the difference.",
  "Because plantation houses are pretty and people are extremely shallow. People also dont fully grasp the horrors that occurred there.",
  "Probably the same reason castles and medieval manor houses aren't since they were essentially the same thing. And, yes, there are semantic differences between slaves and serfs  but IMO if you're \"attached to the land\" and need your lord's permission to relocate, you're no different than a slave.",
  "Cuz people here think the house is pretty... haha. They get married in them and host banquets because of the looks of the pretty house surrounded by flowering magnolia trees.  It's easy to over look the bad when you never lived it.  I don't agree, I'd never get married in one.  But people still go visit the gladiator arena even though it enslaved and killed innocent people.   People still visit the Egyptian pyramids.  People still visit the Aztec ruins where they sacrificed people.  Humans are just fascinated with the macabre. ",
  "There were 46,000 large plantations in the south, comprising most of the usable land. There were 23 primary concentration camps. ",
  "Mainly because the mentality that produced slavery is alive and well in the American South, among other places.",

  "One of the main differences is that concentration camps existed SOLELY for the atrocities committed there. They were literally just death factories.",
  "I have been saying for years that the US would do itself a service by buying a large plantation like this as a national park or national monument. Something with slave quarters still intact. They can tell the story of a slave's life. ",
  "Confederates won the second civil war in 1878, and spent next 60 years making propaganda about how awesome they were.",
  "Because America is a racist nation. Slavery was never abolished.",
  "Because, in addition to being private property, they were farms, not death camps whose sole purpose was to exterminate people. People died, were abused, forcibly preformed labor, but it was in service to farming. After the war, people still needed cotton and food, the government couldn’t just seize valuable land and keep it barren as some kind of monument, that would help nobody. Many of the former slaves went back to work on those same plantations as sharecroppers. After 100 years of being functioning farms and being used for other purposes, the mystique and horror just fades. If you placed off limits anywhere anyone had ever died, been abused, was raped, performed forced labor, you couldn’t do anything anywhere.",
  "It's a bit of a complicated questions because most concentration camps aren't preserved and the ones that are, were the combination work/death camps which played a role in the Holocaust. ",
  "Because they aren’t ashamed of it. There is a large portion of the US population that is perfectly fine with slavery and are incredibly racist.",
  "I'll give you a hint",
  "Because of the historical context. Losing the civil war didn’t mean that these houses became empty. People still lived there. The plantations still operated. They became integrated into post war American life for well over a century. It’s really only when they stopped being used that there was a public reconciliation with their history.",
  "America isn't nearly as ashamed about slavery as Germany is about the Holocaust.",
  "Because unlike Germany, we didn't do a good enough job of shaming those people, and allowed them to continue flying their traitor flags and glorifying their leaders, and spewing crap like \"The South will rise again\", so the racism and hatefulness and confederate \"hero\" worship is still prevalent to this day.",
  "Some are. But you must realize that a very sizable portion of the South still wishes there were slaves, so they can continue to own and control people. Racist tourists and racist brides love it.",
  "Probably because they're architecturally beautiful.  People have weddings, holiday in castles in Europe which in feudal days were no better than plantations, in some ways worse when you account for torture devices such as racks in the dungeons and the spikes on which they displayed cut off heads.",
  "I went to one once, they downplayed the shit out of Slavery in the tour to focus on the collection of trinkets that the family collected. When I heard that one burnt down I just said \"nothing of value was lost\" and moved on. I don't understand how you could open a place like that for the public on the basis of its historic significance and choose to downplay the institution of Slavery and it's role in why the family that lived there was so rich.",

  "Europe has done a lot of work to make sure that there’s a deep understanding of the tragedy that unfolded around the mid-20th century.",
  "Some are - the Whitney Plantation, which is down the road from the one that burned down, is a museum ABOUT slavery and the people in bondage there. They do not host weddings, it is an educational site only, and they are extremely explicit as to their purpose. ",
  "Because the southern US still has a culture that draws on the antebellum south. They are educated to believe that it’s a lost way of life that they missed out on. This was not how the holocaust was treated after its fall. ",
  "A very complex question but the roots of it are the lost  cause myth. ",

  "Americans aren't ashamed of their terrible past because 1/3 of us are apparently still just as ignorant and racist and willing to vote for orange con men.",
  "Plantations look way nicer. Also at the end of the day there just houses. Houses with a shitty history, but houses",
  "Why would they? Slavery sucked, all stop. If it’s a pissing contest, the holocost wins with numbers, brutality, systems development, etc. We fought a war and ended slavery, thank God, and there’s tons of museums dedicated to each piece of cruddy history African Americans have had to endure. However, there’s plenty of slavery throughout history that gets less attention/museums/memorials. Not a bad thing, just a fact that we can only go so far with our memorials. ",
  "Why aren’t former Japanese concentration camps treated like European concentration camps?",
  "Because they’re prettier and the history can be more easily ignored.",
  "Because the owners of former American slave plantations are not nearly as ashamed as the owners of former European concentration camps. There hasn’t been an actual reckoning of American slavery. The conflict over whether or not it should be celebrated as a part of American history is ongoing and stubborn. As a black American, that is even a question at all, disgusts me to my core.",
  "The United States never truly took accountability for its twin crimes of slavery and genocide of native Americans. It’s a white supremacist colonial outpost",
  "Because ultimately they aren’t comparable structures. By this logic, why aren’t European castles where serfs worked/suffered in horrifying conditions torn down as well? Or the colosseum in Rome where slaves fought to the death for sport? ",
  "OP, I think you’re really missing a major truth here. It is rare for governments to both take ownership of atrocities AND to set aside land/ property for the primary purpose of educating people. One major motivation to do so is if there’s enough interest to attract enough tourists to at least self sustain such a project. Few tax payers want their money going towards a sad, unpopular museum.",

You’re not trying hard enough to better yourself. It has nothing to do with race.” But when things go well the response is “That’s not fair! You had preferential treatment! This is racist!”",
  "THEY SHOULD BE",
  "Because in Germany the Nazis were executed and imprisoned after WWII and their ideology was outlawed.

It’s all propaganda, how can we teach that the founding fathers were amazing hero’s if they were also slaving owning monsters?",

Instead, they were allowed to fester and engage in a sick, warped version of reality where they weren't irredeemably evil, they were actually heroes.

Instead, it was normalized to the point that ignorant people actually choose to get married on those killing grounds. It's sickening.",

  "Did you not stop to think about the fact that they were private residences and property, of course the gov can’t just seize it and make it a museum ",

Quickly after the war southern politicians went about whitewashing the war saying it was about “state’s rights” instead of being about slavery as ever articles of secession declared.

  "Not saying the only reason, and I’m sure like 300 people have made the same point, but after the holocaust, the German people went to the extent of enacting laws making denial or downplaying the horrors a crime. After each iteration of racial equality progress in America, on the other hand, we have acted as though racism is: a) a small issue, b) something that took place far further in the past than it actually was, c) not nearly as horrific as anti-American forces would want to make it seem. This includes slavery-era south. To hear Americans talk about it, by and large, it was 400 years ago, not nearly as brutal as liberals would suggest, and only a small number of people actually owned slaves, so it really wasn’t as widespread as it’s made out to be. And that desire to save face by distorting history is a big part of the reason these locations are used and seen as being outside their role as the locations of atrocities whereas concentration/death camp locations aren’t.",

Essentially the company is trying to do damage control now that their years of poor customer service and very high staff turnover has caught up to them.

Why should they get to see my life? So I don’t use socials and I just text people. I’ve lost some connections with people who didn’t want to move form IG to text, people who I caught up with and considered close friends - but I feel like this gives me the opportunity to make real friendships that don’t rely on being connected by viewing each others stories. I just want real connection. Not fake likes.",

Also, posts / reels / videos mentioning a bunch of affiliate stuff or sponsored stuff per post / reel / video or a couple of sponsored posts / reels / videos per day are too much. Going viral thingy is worthless to me. This kind of thing reminds me of current printed magazines or newspapers. 80% out of 100% per magazine or newspapers contains advertisements. ",

  "I stepped back because it went from something I utilized to keep in touch with people to something people use as a tool to be invasive in my life, so I don’t even post anything anymore. If I want to talk to someone I call them on my phone or see them in my day to day. Social media has become a really toxic place for me. So if I get on any apps it’s for different things. Like on Reddit I read about every opposing perspective I can just to learn whereas on instagram I like the most unhinged videos because it’s something I can count on to make me laugh and lift my spirits when I’m down.

Instead of quitting entirely, they are shifting to quieter, more meaningful spaces like private groups, Reddit, or niche communities.",
  "For me it’s a bit of both. Burnout for sure, but also life just changes and what used to feel fun starts feeling like a chore. I stuck around for the memes and some friends I don’t wanna lose touch with, but I’ve definitely scaled back a lot. Stepping back felt freeing.",
  "It started to feel like work to me a few years ago. Keeping up with posting and everything felt like it had to be well thought out and polished. It used to just be your friends now it's your mom's 3rd cousin looking at your photos and it's just a strange form of privacy invasion now.",

  "Is long-term therapy always the client’s decision? Assuming pay is not an issue, are you ok with seeing your clients/patients long-term for many years?",
  "I am both a therapist and a client. I’ve been with my therapist since 2018. I have attachment issues so I’ve brought up your exact question with my therapist a gazillion times and she is always patient with me. After 7 years, I’ve finally realized she actually genuinely likes me and cares about me. And as a therapist, I find my longer-term (I’ve had a few for several years) clients are the ones I’m most comfortable working with just bc I’m so familiar with them and their therapeutic concerns. So as both client and therapist, I actually like the long-term relationships.",
  "It’s funny because I think that about my own therapist and yet as a therapist myself I love working with my longterm clients.",
  "This varies widely by whatever client asks for, but specifically what a client wants out of therapy. I use IFS and it is very common for IFS work to take years, for trauma processing etc. but if a client’s goals are more short term, then we go with that!",
  "No- I love my long term clients. I have some clients that I’ve seen for over 2 years and I look forward to our sessions. I don’t dislike new clients, it’s just different and I appreciate the therapeutic relationship with my OG clients. ",
  "I have seen most of my clients for 3+ years at this point. There is a theory that if you have a healthy attachment with someone for 5 years you can move into an earned secure attachment which can really facilitate healing in the deeper levels. It’s been amazing to see my clients grow over so many years!",
  "I'm happy to stay with a client as long as there is work to do, and they are making progress. As a therapist, it's rewarding to be with a client throughout their healing and growth journey. If the   client is using insurance, we are required to discontinue treatment when they no longer meet diagnostic criteria. However, if the client is paying out of pocket, I'm happy to stay with them through the ups and downs of regular life. I'll generally see those clients once a month.",
  "Not at all.  If anything, I find established patients more interesting because the work is deeper (we've gottten beyonnd all the preliminary stuff and I understand their psychology well and can get to the deeper issues).  Also, they understand how psychoanalytic therapy works (there's generally a re-education process with patients who have been in more superficial therapies previously).",
  "Absolutely",
  "I am happy to see complex patients for years. For less complex folks I think about how long we work together in terms of whether long-term therapy might do more harm than good.",
  "Therapist and client here. I’ve worked with my analyst since 2012. I have no intentions of stopping. And, I love my long-term clients. As long as they want to come & are getting something out of our work together, I want them to come.",
  "It has nothing to do with time and everything to do with goal accomplishment. My therapist instincts tell me when someone is ready and I rely on the client to decide if they are right.",
  "Nooo! I  feel extremely fond of my long term clients and am honoured that they have stuck with me and allowed me to support them during difficult times in their lives. \nAs to when to end, that is entirely up to the client. I will gently raise it as a possibility (whilst making it clear that I'm not 'firing' them!) if I feel they might not need me any more.. In that case we might go down to a session every two weeks or even every month to see how they manage. But it is always, always up to the client. As long as it is does no harm, I am happy to continue with them as long as they want.",
  "As long as it’s appropriate to why they are seeing a therapist, yes. Example is early childhood trauma that can take years to process. However, there is always a concern about dependency which the therapist needs to have on their radar. A good therapist does not want a client to be dependent on them.",
  "Thank you so much, everyone. I guess my question is not only whether it’s appropriate or not to continue to see/treat the long-term client/patient, but the question is whether you feel a resentment, like feeling “forced” to see/treat them. I know this question is not fair, as sometimes work is work and you’d rather not be working sometimes, I guess, but for me personally, I’d hate to be the source of resentment for my therapist because they are “forced” to see me still because I show interest in showing up still, someone who is no longer new and exciting to get to know, but someone who has now opened up about all her problems and there is nothing really new to disclose.",
  "Is it weird that I’m fascinated by very basic, human-level things about my therapist?",
  "This is so real. My therapist hates Subway and I feel special for knowing this completely random, unimportant fact about him 😆 ",
  "I have suspected some of my clients are like this! I once mentioned I was taking a week off to go on a craft retreat and a couple of clients got SO excited for me. \nIt makes sense, I get to hear all about them and all of their things, I suppose it feels nice to be let in on the reverse.",

  "“I’m like a little truffle pig” \nThat comment right there wins the day. And yes me too. Every new thing I learn is like winning the lottery.",
  "I used to feel the same way about teachers in school. Mostly people I admired or had a crush on(even if I didn’t know it at the time). It feels like you’re getting to know them. I guess in terms of therapy it can be a nice change since they know all about you, specially your most intimate thoughts and things you have done. So I guess it feel refreshing to know a bit about them too.",

She was in  the midst of getting her masters.I'll never forget how much she helped me. She was the one who helped me get a psychiatrist which led to my diagnoses of GAD, OCD, ADHD, and PTSD. I remember her full name, her orange tabby Andrew, her pretty blond hair, how she hugged me after our last couple sessions, her love of amethyst, crochet, and arbutus trees. She was the best.\nI check out her linkd in profile every now and then to make sure she's still practicing. Maybe one day when I can afford it I'll reach out lol\nIt's an ironic blessing that I can't get in touch with her for free because I'm no longer in need of crisis counseling thanks to her help 💚💖💙",
  "It's normal. I don't gatekeep information like that about myself as a therapist. I don't mind sharing where I grew up, whether I have pets, how I like my coffee, etc. I have the same curiosity about my own therapist, and she's not weird about it either.",

  "I don't think it's weird at all--one of the cues for self-disclosure is self-disclosing yourself, so since you're doing it all the time it can feel weird that your therapist isn't.  I'm fairly open with my clients and don't mind questions--I'm not a psychoanalyst where the blank slate is part of the therapy--but I do make sure my self-disclosure is in their interest and not because it's fun for me to have someone fascinated by what I'm saying about myself!  I do feel weird if a current client Googles me or looks for stuff about me online--that feels like an invasion of privacy, and as I don't ever do that with clients I don't want them to do that to me--but I don't mind people knowing bits about me if it's helpful for them.",

I somehow landed on this app called Anxwr and it changed my life. Basically it's a micro win journaling app with a twist - attach your identities to those wins. This was a totally new concept for me but it worked wonders and I can't be grateful enough.",

Because of my work as an accountant I was able not only to support myself comfortably, but i was able to support my sister while she went to colllege and my brother while he went through a difficult divorce. In both cases my stable and ample income meant that I could absorb my siblings and their kiddos into my life and support them in their transition.\nNothing in my life has been as effective a vehicle for breaking the cycle of poverty for my family. I am so glad I went into this field.",

We were supposed to tell them that he was on a call at the moment, and then text him and let him know.

  "It's so true! The loudest ones complaining about WFH \"laziness\" are often the same folks who treat the office like their personal hangout. Maybe they're just projecting because they know how much socializing actually cuts into their own work time? It's ironic how they equate being physically present with productivity, while their actual output might tell a different story. Just let them have their office coffee hours while you actually get stuff done in peace.",
  "lol when I was at EY I worked from home until late 2022, and there was a manager who said she was in office every single day asking people for coffee in the teams chat. When I finally went into the office regularly, only saw her like once or twice. She would ask people whos in, without being in her self. Turns out in 2023, she was taking long vacations, charging codes without actually doing work but acting as if she was in office. wild times.",
  "Exactly! The loudest anti-WFH folks often treat the office like a hangout spot. Let people work where they're productive and stop confusing socializing with working.",
  "This post is being used by LinkedInfluencers now...way to go!",
  "My experience is that wfh rarely works. We just laid off a ton of wfh employees who weren't producing and were strictly wfh. SOME people can do it and thrive at it but it should be an earned privilege and typically fails. ",
  "That's why they are against WFH they like wasting time in the office",
  "100% correct. All the pro RTO people I worked with used the office as their social life, not for work. ",
  "Oh yeah! Most are bullies or perverts who want an affair.",
  "You are obviously not a manager. Try being the manager and not working from home.",
  "…best part of a remote job…",
  "I basically see it as an IQ thing. Higher IQ people can generally handle working from home much more easily, and we benefit from it a lot more as well. Low IQ seem to need being in the office more. But really, you have to have a decent IQ to pass the CPA exam and be a CPA anyway, so there really shouldn't be too many CPAs who need to be in office. But I could see it being beneficial for support staff.",
  "It depends. I’ve noticed that a lot of people who seek fully remote jobs tend to be “lazy” or have obligations at home that prevent them from doing more than the bare minimum.",
  "I enjoyed business school but never want to work in accounting again",
  "Its def a boring profession but it provides me financial stability and balance to pursue hobbies outside of work. I do not exactly plan on working in this industry for the rest of my life but its def a stepping stone towards my future goals.",
  "I switched from being an economics major to an accounting major, and I enjoyed economics a lot more. I continued to pursue a minor in economics and I remember my econ classes were legitimately interesting while the accounting classes were a total drag. I dreaded studying for accounting and actually looked forward to studying for economics. Also, the accounting students were generally a lot more one-dimensional and intellectually incurious compared to the econ students, so they were not as fun to be around. ",
  "Being able to do boring things well is my superpower.",
  "Brotha I’ve hated accounting since my first honors class freshman year… comp was too good for what it was",
  "I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely don't love working or have a big passion about what I do; however, I think it is very important to maintain some perspective.",
  "You haven’t even worked in accounting.",
  "Throughout my college/university days, I just \"went to business school\" but knew that Accounting would be my end goal career and enjoyed more straight forward and concrete answers such as the rules and principles that guided accounting.",
  "Yup. This is me. Accounting is interesting to learn about, sucks to practice",
  "Kinda funny, I'm actually the complete opposite. School was so boring but I love my accounting career so far.",
  "Yes. I took a job in tax out of desperation because I didn’t plan ahead with internships to get into the field I wanted to be in. Worst decision/experience of my life. Never again.",
  "I don’t plan on working in this industry forever. Borderline hate it, but it’s not bad at all. ",
  "I liked my accounting classes. Mainly because of my professors, but the actual profession is dreadfully and boring and frankly, starting your career in public is very soul-sucking. No one really talked about it, but they heavily pushed it at my school. I made decent money and I’m happy for what I learned about myself during my time in this industry, but I’m jumping ship and switching to nursing. ",
  "Same. I love business but hate accounting. I’m either going to get an operations controller role or transition to healthcare.",
  "I mean, an accounting degree doesn’t mean posting journal entries for the rest of your life. The industry also makes a big difference.",
  "Me too. I graduated with high honors, but I hate working as an accountant. I want to change my career so bad.",
  "I left after a couple years working in accounting. Definitely agree",
  "Yes. That’s why I’m getting an MBA from a top school",
  "Which field are you applying to",
  "Not me. I definitely enjoy transforming huge data sets into something useable. ",
  "Lies. No one likes business school. ",
  "Between Monday at about 9 and Friday at about 5, I say the exact same thing. Every week! ",
  "Yes I actually never wanna do it at all but im only 5 classes away from graduating switched majors twice so am not gonna switch it again. Idk what the future holds 💀",
  "I HATED my brief time as a staff accountant in real estate. I enjoyed other industries quite a bit more (or was less bored at least).",
  "I was a staff in audit for a year. Tax for 2 months. Absolutely hated it. Now I’m in investment banking, start tomorrow. Hopefully that goes better. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Goal is to just make enough money to open a coffee shop and wine and charcuterie place with my fiance/ soon to be wife. Idk how you guys do that for 20+ years. I feel especially bad for new graduates. PE taking over, expansion of foreign teams, having to redo their work on top of your own, 60-70 hour weeks during busy season and 40-50 during non busy season. Sure you can make 150 a year in 5-7 years, after giving up all of your free time for 4 months out of the year every year. But that doesn’t even buy you a house in a lot of metros anymore bigger than a 2 bed 1 bath. I’m sure accounting used to be a solid career, and still might be if you don’t want to have a life for a number of years. But I’m just not willing to give up that time to make someone else millions of dollars."
